        The <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> element is used to represent a section of content that is tangentially related to the content around it. It is often used for sidebars, pull quotes, or other content that is not directly part of the main content but provides additional context or information.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, an <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> element might contain a list of related links, a brief biography of the author, or advertisements. It is typically placed alongside the main content but can also be used within articles or sections to provide supplementary information.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> element can be used multiple times within a document, allowing for various side content to be displayed in different sections. It is a semantic element that helps improve the structure and accessibility of web pages by clearly defining content that is related but not essential to the main narrative.

            The <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element is used to represent a self-contained composition in a document, page, or site that is intended to be independently distributable or reusable. It can be a blog post, news article, forum post, or any other content that can stand alone and be understood without additional context.
        </p>
        <aside>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element is often used in conjunction with other semantic elements like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> to create a well-structured document. It helps search engines and assistive technologies understand the content better, improving accessibility and SEO.
